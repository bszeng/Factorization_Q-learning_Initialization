# Factorization Q-learning Initialization

The proposed framework works as an add-on of Q-learning and captures the potential correlation between states and
actions from the explored experiences to predict the unknown Q-values in an open-source simulated 5G network.

## How to use
* **Set the number of antennas in the base station**. In `environment.py` change the line `self.M_ULA` to the values of your choice. The code expects M = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.
* **Run Q-learning and its variants algorithms**. Run the scripts `main_QL.py`, `main_DynaQ.py`, `main_DQL.py`,`main_QlL.py`,  and `main_SQL.py`. The result is the same as that in folder `Results`.  
* **Show the results**. Run the script `Results_plot.ipynb` in folder `Results` to show the figures and tables in the paper.
